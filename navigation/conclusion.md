### Conclusion: How to make the perfect game story?

To make a perfect game story is impossible. However, there are many key components of a game story which can enhance the story: Balance, Heart, Realism, and Depth. Any one of these components will make a good game story, but using multiple can enhance a story even further. A story with perfect balance between game and story, said story havinng heart and depth, with realistic aspects of the world would make for the perfect story.

Which is what Outer Wilds presumably is. I, unfortunately, have yet to play Outer Wilds. I will one day though, and will add to this page.
